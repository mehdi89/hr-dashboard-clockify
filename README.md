- **time_entries**: Time tracking records imported from Clockify
- **import_logs**: Records of CSV imports including status and summary information
- **users**: User accounts for authentication and system access

## Deployment

This application is configured for deployment to Vercel with Neon DB PostgreSQL integration:

1. See the [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) file for detailed instructions on deploying to Vercel with Neon DB
2. The deployment process includes:
   - Setting up a Neon DB PostgreSQL database
   - Configuring environment variables in Vercel
   - Automatic database migrations during deployment
   - Creating an admin user for initial access

## Data Import Format

The application expects Clockify CSV reports with the following columns:
- User (employee's name in Clockify)
- Project
- Start Date
- Duration (decimal) or Duration (h)

All employees in the Clockify report must first be added to the system with matching `clockifyName` values.
